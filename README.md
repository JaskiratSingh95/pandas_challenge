# pandas_challenge
In this pandas challenge we received data from the school district.
After looking through the given uncleaned data and after performing data inspection and cleaning using pandas. This was done to the data of the city school district in order to have a better understand the relationships in expenditure and the academic success of the schools of the area. After a initial analysis of the data, I have arrived at the following conclusions:
The over all budget of the district is close to 24 million USD
Overall passing rate is 65%.
Schools with higher budget were able to get higher results across reading and writing categories as well as the over all passing. There is a strong linear relationship between budget and kids passing with at least 70%.
